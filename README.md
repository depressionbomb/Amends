# **Amends**
"To get a second chance, to heal from the present or the past. Amends aims to add two new unique alternative endings for both Artificer and Hunter's campaigns, to give them a true happy ending."

Amends is a mod that aims towards a new ending, a happier ending, for the Hunter and Artificer campaigns (not for ship reasons :sob:)

it adds a new region as well, The Conservatorium, a greenhouse and botanical garden, filled with temples and grand views out into the Expanse beyond the walls.
